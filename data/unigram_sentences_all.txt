sadly the recent killing of black man woman and child by the police be fatal interaction in a long history of state violence
Police killing demonstrate the need for well law enforcement practice
these fatal interaction reinforce the need to reform policy that place black under great police scrutiny and lead to disadvantage throughout the criminal justice system
a future for black people in America must include a concept of public safety not define by arrest admission to prison or lengthy prison term
where -PRON- go from here require new public safety priority that scale back excessive prison sentence prioritize evidence base intervention that reduce criminal justice involvement and establish community level initiative in high incarceration neighborhood
end black disadvantage in the criminal justice system involve address admission to prison and length of confinement
Congress and legislative body in almost every state have enact law mandatory minimum three strike and
-PRON- be out policy which can result in a life sentence and truth in sentencing provision that send more people to prison and incarcerate -PRON- for long period of time
in addition the share of prison admission for person who violate parole many for technical violation not new crime have double in recent decade from one be six in the 1980s to one in three today
accord to criminologist Michael Tonry country have the policy and prison population -PRON- choose
between 1965 and 1990 a period during which overall and violent crime rate triple in Germany Finland and the United States german politician choose to hold the imprisonment rate flat finnish politician choose to substantially reduce -PRON- and american politician generally enact policy that send more people to prison along with lengthen prison term
black defendant experience disadvantage due to policy and practice that disparately affect black include enhanced penalty in drug free school zone and recidivist sentencing enhancement
disadvantage accumulate at each step of the process contribute to Blacks and Latinos comprise 56 of the incarcerated population yet only 30 of the U.S. Population
if recent trend continue one of every three black boy can expect to go to prison in -PRON- lifetime as can one of every six Latino boy compare to one of every seventeen white boy
small but still substantial racial and ethnic disparity also persist among woman
study show that harsh sentencing law for certain offense often have a disparate impact on black defendant as a result of how sentence law interact with broad racial difference in -PRON- society and within the criminal justice system
a study of judicial practice in Pennsylvania find that young black man be perceive to not have stabilize social bond like a supportive family or living wage employment
consequently black male defendant be view as a risk to public safety less reformable and less likely to have suffer mitigating victimization
research have reinforce the high cost of be B]lack young and male and specifically the continue significance of race in american society
the politic of Black Lives Matter offer an opportunity for a new public safety framework to emerge
to substantially reduce the prison population will require both state specific strategy and federal reform
the framework must be accountable to community concern that prioritize direct engagement with justice involve person and -PRON- family
those concern should inform change in policy and practice to eliminate black disadvantage at all level of the justice system
in order to achieve a broad approach to public safety -PRON- need to focus on substantial sentencing reform and target intervention that reduce contact with the criminal justice system
first -PRON- must scale back lengthy prison term even for more serious crime
the 21-year old former gang member convict of robbery may be a very different person at age 30
second -PRON- must prioritize program like the Nurse Family Partnership a visitation program that have demonstrate that home visit can significantly reduce arrest rate for child and -PRON- mother
finally -PRON- must focus resource to strengthen effective remedy in high incarceration community
research show that a community level approach can be effective at reduce crime both by create opportunity and by enhance informal social control mechanism
-PRON- will know black life matter when public safety response be not define by arrest or prison admission but by work to reduce contact with the criminal justice system in the first place
