at the Reclaim MLK Day march in Oakland last month a troop of young girl of color sport brown vest and beret and hold sign that say Black life matter
-PRON- be member of the Radical Brownies a social justice sisterhood for girl identify child of color age eight to twelve that hope to nurture the next generation of leader
similar to Girl Scouts participate in educational activity like the Reclaim MLK Day march earn member badge
but that system and the vest the Brownies wear be the only similarity between the two group
in fact the brown beret be much more telling of the troop 's actual mission and vision
pay homage to Oakland 's legacy of social justice advocacy by group such as the Black Panthers and the Brown Berets the hat appropriately position the girl as the new addition to that ongoing movement
the idea be bear when Anayvette Martinez a community organizer in East Oakland school recognize that -PRON- fourth grade daughter be yearn to be part of a girl group and gain a solid sense of sisterhood outside of school
Martinez begin dream of what a girl group would look like
that embody -PRON- family 's radical political value
-PRON- find other great Oakland organization for youth but none that specifically serve young girl of color with the value -PRON- envision
so -PRON- decide to build one
-PRON- ask educator Marilyn Holinquest whom -PRON- meet in the Ethnic Studies graduate program at San Francisco State University year ago to co lead the project and contribute -PRON- teaching expertise
from there -PRON- simply ask around in -PRON- network to see if -PRON- friend daughter would like to join
a lot of family be like
oh -PRON- God -PRON- totally have always want a space like this for -PRON- daughter say Martinez
quickly the group grow to twelve girl before -PRON- decide to cap the admission
in December the troop begin meet twice a month to embark on -PRON- unit base curriculum
the lesson plan draw from a mixture of topic that Martinez and Holinquest wish -PRON- have be introduce to as young girl of color contemporary political issue and movement take place in the world and collaboration with other social justice group in -PRON- community
amid the many anti racial injustice rally take place in Oakland in recent month -PRON- only make sense that one of the first unit should be about the black Lives Matter movement
Martinez and Holinquest say that broach such a heavy topic with child can be difficult but be absolutely necessary
-PRON- point out that when thing be happen in the world parent often assume that child be not pay attention when in fact -PRON- be
-PRON- too be surround by the medium and -PRON- listen to what adult be talk about even though -PRON- may not fully understand
if -PRON- be not talk to -PRON- directly or -PRON- do not have a dedicated space to talk about the issue that concern -PRON- that -PRON- want explanation around or context for
then -PRON- have a lot of question that go unanswere say Holinquest who have a young step daughter and year of experience as a teacher
when teach the black Lives Matter unit Holinquest start off with a word association exercise around topic and name like Michael Brown to gauge what the girl already know then work through and clarify -PRON- understanding add historical context
next the girl participate in three community action in solidarity with black life Matter include the Reclaiming MLK Day march
Holinquest explain that -PRON- always make sure to follow education with action in order to empower the girl with a sense of agency rather than hopelessness
often when -PRON- learn about something and how deep -PRON- go -PRON- can feel overwhelmed -PRON- say
-PRON- want to maintain -PRON- hope and cultivate hope so that -PRON- can continue to do these action to sustain change

-PRON- want to truly empower -PRON- so that -PRON- can contribute to the social justice legacy
at the end of this month the girl will be receive -PRON- black life matter badge which Martinez and Holinquest have custom make
for the final step a black live matter organizer will personally present the badge to the girl and Alicia Garza one of the co founder of the movement will give a final lesson to the troop
Garza will be the first of many local female role model that Martinez and Holinquest plan to introduce to the troop
a large part of -PRON- mission be to teach the girl to be fierce community advocate and be unwavere in -PRON- solidarity with other who align with -PRON- value
-PRON- really want -PRON- to understand that on a core level in -PRON- bone say Holinquest
the girl have also start -PRON- Radical Beauty unit in which -PRON- learn about accept -PRON- body despite societal pressure and norm perpetuate by the medium and pop culture
the next will be Radical Love in which -PRON- learn about self care and participate in activity such as assess whether a friendship be healthy for -PRON- or not
for Valentine 's Day -PRON- will write love letter to -PRON- and -PRON- sister and discuss quote from bell hooks and other feminist of color
Martinez notice that even though -PRON- daughter be still young -PRON- already feel competition from other girl and social pressure to present a certain way
if -PRON- learn how to deal with these obstacle now -PRON- will be emotionally solid when -PRON- be old and ready to take on the world
although the troop be only a few month old the initiative have be receive an overwhelming wave of nationwide medium attention and an outpouring of community support along with -PRON-
Martinez say -PRON- have a feeling -PRON- would be popular in the Bay Area but have no idea
-PRON- would blow up to the extent that -PRON- have
despite be flood with request for chapter in other city and local request to join the leader plan to spend the rest of the year focus on develop the curriculum and the Radical Brownies culture with -PRON- current full troop
but -PRON- definitely intend to expand in the future
everything -PRON- be develop be design to scale up so that when -PRON- be ready -PRON- will have lesson plan to share and training guide for troop leader
-PRON- be currently reach out to organization for financial sponsorship but eventually plan to become -PRON- own nonprofit
-PRON- welcome the support but want to move slowly now to go fast later
-PRON- have a vision of create something really different and sustainable for -PRON- and for the community say Martinez
when the Eagles clinch -PRON- first ever Super Bowl victory on Sunday that will always feel wild to say -PRON- friend and -PRON- join the joyful inebriated throng in a spontaneous pilgrimage to Philadelphia 's City Hall
and at Thursday 's championship parade -PRON- 'd likely hear many of the same full throated chant that -PRON- hear right after the win
the Eagles fight song obviously
some colorful suggestion for what the vanquish Tom Brady could do to -PRON- also obviously
and then another more charge exhortation Free Meek Mill
Meek Mill whose real name be Robert Williams be one of the high profile rapper ever to come from philly
and when the Eagles run out onto the field on Super Bowl Sunday -PRON- do so over Meek 's Dreams and Nightmares a song that -PRON- have be play at the team 's practice since the playoff begin
the Eagles pick Dreams and Nightmares as -PRON- hype song for functional reason -PRON- be a song about overcome long odd and construct to make -PRON- feel like -PRON- can run through a brick wall but there be something political about the choice as well
Meek have be on probation for nearly a decade stem from a gun conviction in 2008 when -PRON- be 21
then last year -PRON- be sentence to two to four year in prison for violate those probation term
-PRON- have a long and spotty probation history with a grip of fail drug test and miss court appearance some of which extend -PRON- probation
none of which be especially remarkable for people on probation which be exactly why -PRON- have become a poster boy for critic of the criminal justice system
-PRON- point out that fail a drug test or drive outside of the county or failure to hold down a job be not jailable offense for anyone but probationer
for Meek the violation that finally get -PRON- send to prison be an airport fight and a reckless driving charge for pop a wheelie on a motorcycle in a video -PRON- post to Instagram even though charge in both instance be drop
several Eagles player have express public support for Meek after -PRON- sentencing and show up at a rally in Center City last fall to protest -PRON- incarceration
there be many many people of far less mean than Meek Mill in similar bind ostensibly free but constrain by -PRON- probation term
imagine try to find a job or public housing with a felony conviction and restriction on where -PRON- can travel
there be currently more Americans on probation than on parole in prison or in jail combine and the racial disparity in probation be as stark as -PRON- be in every other part of -PRON- criminal justice system
a 2014 study by the Urban Institute find that across four different county in the U.S. black probationer be 55 percent more likely to have -PRON- probation revoke than white people be
Meek 's story come just as Philadelphia rethink -PRON- approach to crime and punishment
for decade Philly 's district attorney have be notoriously tough on crime which be one reason the city currently have the high incarceration rate of the 10 large U.S. city
but the current mayor Jim Kenney run on a platform of police reform and get rid of stop and frisk
and the new DA Larry Krasner be a former defense lawyer who make -PRON- name sue the police department want to abolish cash bail and be champion by activist from Occupy Philly and Black Lives Matter
as -PRON- may imagine that have not always engender -PRON- to the city 's police and prosecutorial brass
-PRON- be fitting then that the Eagles manage to smuggle a little of this messy context however briefly and however elliptically into the Super Bowl
the NFL try -PRON- good to hermetically seal the game off from the tension roil the wide world
any notion that the NFL exist outside the sphere of politic be always a tortured fiction and -PRON- be demolish for good this season when the big storyline be the on field protest around race and the criminal justice system
in a move that seem especially aim at reassure fan who may have be turn off by that kneeling and feel -PRON- unpatriotic there be an especially showy celebration of several World War II veteran during the coin toss
there be no visible protest on display that day not even from Malcolm Jenkins the Eagles outspoken safety
but there be Meek at least if only in sound and spirit

sadly the recent killing of black man woman and child by the police be fatal interaction in a long history of state violence
Police killing demonstrate the need for well law enforcement practice
these fatal interaction reinforce the need to reform policy that place black under great police scrutiny and lead to disadvantage throughout the criminal justice system
a future for black people in America must include a concept of public safety not define by arrest admission to prison or lengthy prison term
where -PRON- go from here require new public safety priority that scale back excessive prison sentence prioritize evidence base intervention that reduce criminal justice involvement and establish community level initiative in high incarceration neighborhood
end black disadvantage in the criminal justice system involve address admission to prison and length of confinement
Congress and legislative body in almost every state have enact law mandatory minimum three strike and
-PRON- be out policy which can result in a life sentence and truth in sentencing provision that send more people to prison and incarcerate -PRON- for long period of time
in addition the share of prison admission for person who violate parole many for technical violation not new crime have double in recent decade from one be six in the 1980s to one in three today
accord to criminologist Michael Tonry country have the policy and prison population -PRON- choose
between 1965 and 1990 a period during which overall and violent crime rate triple in Germany Finland and the United States german politician choose to hold the imprisonment rate flat finnish politician choose to substantially reduce -PRON- and american politician generally enact policy that send more people to prison along with lengthen prison term
black defendant experience disadvantage due to policy and practice that disparately affect black include enhanced penalty in drug free school zone and recidivist sentencing enhancement
disadvantage accumulate at each step of the process contribute to Blacks and Latinos comprise 56 of the incarcerated population yet only 30 of the U.S. Population
if recent trend continue one of every three black boy can expect to go to prison in -PRON- lifetime as can one of every six Latino boy compare to one of every seventeen white boy
small but still substantial racial and ethnic disparity also persist among woman
study show that harsh sentencing law for certain offense often have a disparate impact on black defendant as a result of how sentence law interact with broad racial difference in -PRON- society and within the criminal justice system
a study of judicial practice in Pennsylvania find that young black man be perceive to not have stabilize social bond like a supportive family or living wage employment
consequently black male defendant be view as a risk to public safety less reformable and less likely to have suffer mitigating victimization
research have reinforce the high cost of be B]lack young and male and specifically the continue significance of race in american society
the politic of Black Lives Matter offer an opportunity for a new public safety framework to emerge
to substantially reduce the prison population will require both state specific strategy and federal reform
the framework must be accountable to community concern that prioritize direct engagement with justice involve person and -PRON- family
those concern should inform change in policy and practice to eliminate black disadvantage at all level of the justice system
in order to achieve a broad approach to public safety -PRON- need to focus on substantial sentencing reform and target intervention that reduce contact with the criminal justice system
first -PRON- must scale back lengthy prison term even for more serious crime
the 21-year old former gang member convict of robbery may be a very different person at age 30
second -PRON- must prioritize program like the Nurse Family Partnership a visitation program that have demonstrate that home visit can significantly reduce arrest rate for child and -PRON- mother
finally -PRON- must focus resource to strengthen effective remedy in high incarceration community
research show that a community level approach can be effective at reduce crime both by create opportunity and by enhance informal social control mechanism
-PRON- will know black life matter when public safety response be not define by arrest or prison admission but by work to reduce contact with the criminal justice system in the first place

each day in February this series will look at one of 28 different cultural and political issue affect black life from education to criminal justice reform
