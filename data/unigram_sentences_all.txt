Junior Gabrielle Shuman co chair of political affair for BSU say student have be adamant that -PRON- protest be part of a large movement
-PRON- ’ not just about -PRON- problem as cal student
this be about black people in America -PRON- say
that be say within that -PRON- feel -PRON- ’ important to tell -PRON- story as black student at Cal
the student have also express -PRON- own campus experience through speak word and poetry accord to freshman Zaynab AbdulQadir
before the January 3 protest student send out a press release that reference the 2014 Campus Climate Survey that find that half of black student at UC Berkeley feel prejudge by faculty base on -PRON- identity or background
the survey reveal that 50 of black student feel -PRON- do not have the same opportunity for success as -PRON- classmate and various racial ethnic group unanimously agree that black student have some of the bad condition on campus regard climate and respect from peer
since California adopt Proposition 209 in 1998 which forbid UC school from use race as a criterion for admission the percentage of black UC Berkeley student have be halve
in 2012 there be 874 african american undergraduate student about 3 of the total student body accord to a UC Berkeley diversity census
-PRON- ’ pretty hard when -PRON- do not see people like -PRON- when -PRON- do not see people who have a similar perspective say Spencer Pritchard a senior
-PRON- describe be in a lecture hall with hundred of student but few black student as isolating
Shuman say -PRON- ’ difficult to articulate the negative experience feel by black student because other student usually be not blatantly racist -PRON- say
rather student may appropriate black culture or make fun of be ghetto
student may make black joke or say be -PRON- ok if -PRON- say n around -PRON-
do -PRON- mind that
simon say -PRON- first experience of racism at Cal be when a racial slur be carve on a wall in a Clark Kerr dormitory where -PRON- live
-PRON- also recall a professor use a racial slur in class to say -PRON- do not understand why hip hop artist call each other n—–. be one of few black student in class Simons remember the whole room stare at -PRON-
Abioye say -PRON- negative classroom experience have mostly involve fellow student
-PRON- ’ one of the few black student in -PRON- department
a lot of people assume that -PRON- can not do the work or -PRON- be not smart -PRON- say add that the assumption show when the student be ask to form group or work together in class and some student do not want to work with -PRON-
Abioye who be originally from Oakland attend a predominantly black high school
as a freshman -PRON- do not live on an african american themed floor
-PRON- be an abrupt transition
two black people live on the floor and -PRON- be expect to represent all black people -PRON- say
Pritchard say -PRON- friend have be target of racial slur hurl by drunken student while pass fraternity row on -PRON- way home
-PRON- definitely happen all the time and -PRON- ’ hard to deal with -PRON- say
there have be other issue with fraternity
during Shuman ’s freshman year the fraternity Theta Delta Chi which happen to be locate across the street from a dormitory that have an african american theme program hang a zombie Halloween decoration a pair of jean and a shirt stuff with straw top with a gray head from a noose outside -PRON- building for -PRON- annual charity Halloween party
the zombie look like a black man Shuman say
-PRON- be outraged and disgusted -PRON- say
student take the issue to student government and the fraternity take the decoration down and apologize
one of the place where black student on campus feel safe be the Afro House an african american themed student co op say Shuman
-PRON- ’ also affordable
-PRON- say 19 or 20 of the 21 student that live there be black
several other first year student eat meal and participate in activity at the house through the Donald Foster Boarder Scholarship program
for about 10 year no black student live at the house Shuman say
in 2011 2012 one black woman live at the Afro House the following year six black man include Pritchard live in the house
the group who call -PRON- the Afro Six launch a campaign to reclaim the space
by 2013 2014 all but one resident of the house identify as black
-PRON- do not come across a lot of space by and for black student
-PRON- really really have to fight for -PRON- Shuman say
Freshman AbdulQadir live on an african american theme floor in -PRON- dormitory
although -PRON- ’ able to surround -PRON- with student who have similar viewpoint -PRON- say -PRON- experience many micro aggression on campus every day
-PRON- see -PRON- as a black student before -PRON- see -PRON- as a UC Berkeley student -PRON- say
the fact that campus climate be an issue be not news to administration say Gibor Basri Vice Chancellor for Equity and Inclusion
Basri who create -PRON- position more than seven year ago say improve the campus climate have be one of the top strategic goal since the Equity and Inclusion Department be found
the Campus Climate Survey which include question such as do -PRON- feel exclude from study group or social situation
and do the faculty make assumption about -PRON-
produce confirmatory datum that black staff student and faculty feel the least include of any of the group identify within the survey Basri say
Basri note that the survey show that most exclusionary incident occur between student
People seem to think faculty to student be the issue but that be minor compare to student to student -PRON- say
however Basri add that faculty be responsible for what go on in -PRON- classroom
the survey which be take by student across the UC system in 2013 show a correlation between the perceive respect level specific group have on campus and the number of student of that group attend a university
-PRON- see the climate issue as essentially one of critical mass say Basri
-PRON- just do not have enough african american student at UC Berkeley
so -PRON- do not feel isolated -PRON- say
only 40 of all student accept by Cal go on to attend the school
if more of the admit black student would attend Cal that could help solve the problem -PRON- say
-PRON- be look to get outside agency foundation whatever to provide target financial aid Basri say
the university be also try to attract more transfer student
generally transfer student be a more diverse population than the freshman class -PRON- say
besides increase the black student population the department will continue fund innovation grant that encourage student and staff to propose project that could improve equity and inclusion Basri say
a number of nice initiative have come from past innovation grant such as Bears Baking Bread which bring together palestinian and israeli student to bake bread together and have dialogue -PRON- say
in response to the campus climate survey finding a number of new initiative will take place in the spring
there will be several symposium focus on the climate for racial minority on campus and Graduate Student Instructor training will include discussion of climate issue
staff will receive an email about the issue and a group of about ten faculty member be work out how to get instructor into a room to discuss the issue Basri say
a professor from the psychology department hope to make climate on campus the focus of special discussion session within a new course call critical dialogue
student would be encourage to take what -PRON- learn back to -PRON- dorm
for several year Basri say black administrator have hold monthly breakfast where student can attend and discuss issue
three top administrator at the school be black
Basri Vice Chancellor Harry Le Grande and Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Claude Steele
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs for Residential and Student Service Programs LeNorman Strong be also african american
Shuman say representative from BSU plan to meet with administration in February to discuss condition for black student on campus
despite these effort many student feel the university be not do enough
if -PRON- really prioritize or care about student -PRON- ’d hope -PRON- ’d be do way more than -PRON- be simon say
however -PRON- acknowledge that black faculty have be supportive of black student particularly after effigy hang around campus by an anonymous artist collective leave many student traumatize
-PRON- stage a protest during final week when -PRON- know -PRON- be take final which mean a lot to black student -PRON- say
counseling hour be extend for black student during final AbdulQadir say
simon say -PRON- ’ speak up to make the university a well place where student be treat fairly and equally
that ’ all -PRON- goal be -PRON- say

-PRON- do not need an account on those site to view important information
the idea be bear when Anayvette Martinez a community organizer in East Oakland school recognize that -PRON- fourth grade daughter be yearn to be part of a girl group and gain a solid sense of sisterhood outside of school
Martinez begin dream of what a girl group would look like
that embody -PRON- family 's radical political value
-PRON- find other great Oakland organization for youth but none that specifically serve young girl of color with the value -PRON- envision
so -PRON- decide to build one
-PRON- ask educator Marilyn Holinquest whom -PRON- meet in the Ethnic Studies graduate program at San Francisco State University year ago to co lead the project and contribute -PRON- teaching expertise
from there -PRON- simply ask around in -PRON- network to see if -PRON- friend daughter would like to join
a lot of family be like
oh -PRON- God -PRON- totally have always want a space like this for -PRON- daughter say Martinez
quickly the group grow to twelve girl before -PRON- decide to cap the admission
in December the troop begin meet twice a month to embark on -PRON- unit base curriculum
the lesson plan draw from a mixture of topic that Martinez and Holinquest wish -PRON- have be introduce to as young girl of color contemporary political issue and movement take place in the world and collaboration with other social justice group in -PRON- community
amid the many anti racial injustice rally take place in Oakland in recent month -PRON- only make sense that one of the first unit should be about the black Lives Matter movement
Martinez and Holinquest say that broach such a heavy topic with child can be difficult but be absolutely necessary
-PRON- point out that when thing be happen in the world parent often assume that child be not pay attention when in fact -PRON- be
-PRON- too be surround by the medium and -PRON- listen to what adult be talk about even though -PRON- may not fully understand
if -PRON- be not talk to -PRON- directly or -PRON- do not have a dedicated space to talk about the issue that concern -PRON- that -PRON- want explanation around or context for
then -PRON- have a lot of question that go unanswere say Holinquest who have a young step daughter and year of experience as a teacher
when teach the black Lives Matter unit Holinquest start off with a word association exercise around topic and name like Michael Brown to gauge what the girl already know then work through and clarify -PRON- understanding add historical context
next the girl participate in three community action in solidarity with black life Matter include the Reclaiming MLK Day march
Holinquest explain that -PRON- always make sure to follow education with action in order to empower the girl with a sense of agency rather than hopelessness
often when -PRON- learn about something and how deep -PRON- go -PRON- can feel overwhelmed -PRON- say
-PRON- want to maintain -PRON- hope and cultivate hope so that -PRON- can continue to do these action to sustain change

-PRON- want to truly empower -PRON- so that -PRON- can contribute to the social justice legacy
at the end of this month the girl will be receive -PRON- black life matter badge which Martinez and Holinquest have custom make
for the final step a black live matter organizer will personally present the badge to the girl and Alicia Garza one of the co founder of the movement will give a final lesson to the troop
Garza will be the first of many local female role model that Martinez and Holinquest plan to introduce to the troop
a large part of -PRON- mission be to teach the girl to be fierce community advocate and be unwavere in -PRON- solidarity with other who align with -PRON- value
-PRON- really want -PRON- to understand that on a core level in -PRON- bone say Holinquest
the girl have also start -PRON- Radical Beauty unit in which -PRON- learn about accept -PRON- body despite societal pressure and norm perpetuate by the medium and pop culture
the next will be Radical Love in which -PRON- learn about self care and participate in activity such as assess whether a friendship be healthy for -PRON- or not
for Valentine 's Day -PRON- will write love letter to -PRON- and -PRON- sister and discuss quote from bell hooks and other feminist of color
Martinez notice that even though -PRON- daughter be still young -PRON- already feel competition from other girl and social pressure to present a certain way
if -PRON- learn how to deal with these obstacle now -PRON- will be emotionally solid when -PRON- be old and ready to take on the world
although the troop be only a few month old the initiative have be receive an overwhelming wave of nationwide medium attention and an outpouring of community support along with -PRON-
Martinez say -PRON- have a feeling -PRON- would be popular in the Bay Area but have no idea
-PRON- would blow up to the extent that -PRON- have
despite be flood with request for chapter in other city and local request to join the leader plan to spend the rest of the year focus on develop the curriculum and the Radical Brownies culture with -PRON- current full troop
but -PRON- definitely intend to expand in the future
everything -PRON- be develop be design to scale up so that when -PRON- be ready -PRON- will have lesson plan to share and training guide for troop leader
-PRON- be currently reach out to organization for financial sponsorship but eventually plan to become -PRON- own nonprofit
-PRON- welcome the support but want to move slowly now to go fast later
-PRON- have a vision of create something really different and sustainable for -PRON- and for the community say Martinez
sadly the recent killing of black man woman and child by the police be fatal interaction in a long history of state violence
Police killing demonstrate the need for well law enforcement practice
these fatal interaction reinforce the need to reform policy that place black under great police scrutiny and lead to disadvantage throughout the criminal justice system
a future for black people in America must include a concept of public safety not define by arrest admission to prison or lengthy prison term
where -PRON- go from here require new public safety priority that scale back excessive prison sentence prioritize evidence base intervention that reduce criminal justice involvement and establish community level initiative in high incarceration neighborhood
end black disadvantage in the criminal justice system involve address admission to prison and length of confinement
Congress and legislative body in almost every state have enact law mandatory minimum three strike and
-PRON- be out policy which can result in a life sentence and truth in sentencing provision that send more people to prison and incarcerate -PRON- for long period of time
in addition the share of prison admission for person who violate parole many for technical violation not new crime have double in recent decade from one be six in the 1980s to one in three today
accord to criminologist Michael Tonry country have the policy and prison population -PRON- choose
between 1965 and 1990 a period during which overall and violent crime rate triple in Germany Finland and the United States german politician choose to hold the imprisonment rate flat finnish politician choose to substantially reduce -PRON- and american politician generally enact policy that send more people to prison along with lengthen prison term
black defendant experience disadvantage due to policy and practice that disparately affect black include enhanced penalty in drug free school zone and recidivist sentencing enhancement
disadvantage accumulate at each step of the process contribute to Blacks and Latinos comprise 56 of the incarcerated population yet only 30 of the U.S. Population
if recent trend continue one of every three black boy can expect to go to prison in -PRON- lifetime as can one of every six Latino boy compare to one of every seventeen white boy
small but still substantial racial and ethnic disparity also persist among woman
study show that harsh sentencing law for certain offense often have a disparate impact on black defendant as a result of how sentence law interact with broad racial difference in -PRON- society and within the criminal justice system
a study of judicial practice in Pennsylvania find that young black man be perceive to not have stabilize social bond like a supportive family or living wage employment
consequently black male defendant be view as a risk to public safety less reformable and less likely to have suffer mitigating victimization
research have reinforce the high cost of be B]lack young and male and specifically the continue significance of race in american society
the politic of Black Lives Matter offer an opportunity for a new public safety framework to emerge
to substantially reduce the prison population will require both state specific strategy and federal reform
the framework must be accountable to community concern that prioritize direct engagement with justice involve person and -PRON- family
those concern should inform change in policy and practice to eliminate black disadvantage at all level of the justice system
in order to achieve a broad approach to public safety -PRON- need to focus on substantial sentencing reform and target intervention that reduce contact with the criminal justice system
first -PRON- must scale back lengthy prison term even for more serious crime
the 21-year old former gang member convict of robbery may be a very different person at age 30
second -PRON- must prioritize program like the Nurse Family Partnership a visitation program that have demonstrate that home visit can significantly reduce arrest rate for child and -PRON- mother
finally -PRON- must focus resource to strengthen effective remedy in high incarceration community
research show that a community level approach can be effective at reduce crime both by create opportunity and by enhance informal social control mechanism
-PRON- will know black life matter when public safety response be not define by arrest or prison admission but by work to reduce contact with the criminal justice system in the first place

in a related report by the Inquisitr even as the black life Matter protest movement grow in size the KKK have be expand and be say to be target Afghanistan war veteran who have recently come home to the United States
a former Imperial Wizard for the Ku Klux Klan attack Nicki Minaj go so far as to claim that black people do not really invent hip hop
the Ku Klux Klan propaganda denounce Martin Luther King Jr. as a communist be distribute in California during the commemoration of the holiday
leaflet be find distribute in bag contain a rock and candy which in the past have earn these new flier the nickname of Kandygrams
but the message contain in the KKK leaflet be hardly sweet
under the order of U. S. Attorney General Bobby Kennedy the FBI wire King ’s office and hotel room from 1963 to 1968
these tape notably record -PRON- transaction with communist agent but also wild interracial sex orgy which include act of perversion
King ’s aid would use tax exempt money donate to -PRON- southern Christian Leadership conference to hire white prostitute to perform sexual act with -PRON-
King often would use two prostitute at the same time
these shocking tape be order seal for 50 year by U.S. Federal Judge John Smith Jr. on January 31 1977
in other word -PRON- will not be able to learn all the gory detail until the year 2027
some 90 congressman lead by the late rep Larry McDonald urge Congress to find out what be on these tape before -PRON- approve the disgraceful King Holiday Bill
a cowardly and spineless Congress vote 338 to 90 approve the King Holiday
still many have be able to learn some of the shocking incident record in the King tape
Washington ’s
old Willard Hotel be the scene of King force white woman to drink black russian and perform sexual act with -PRON-
in Las Vegas King ’s aid pay $ 100 each to prostitute to join -PRON- in orgy
in New York city King get drunk and threaten a young white girl work for civil right to submit to -PRON- strange sexual taste or -PRON- would jump from the 13th floor window
-PRON- succumb to prove to loyalty to King
in Norway King be nude when stop by police while chase a woman down a hotel corridor
in Los Angeles a dentist supporter of King be outraged when -PRON- discover -PRON- wife engage in weird sexual act with the civil right leader
King be force to flee the city after the dentist threaten to kill -PRON-
this escapade be tape on February 20 1968
the follow April someone else would shoot King
be this the kind of man -PRON- want to hold up to -PRON- child to be honor as a national hero
the californian branch of the Ku Klux Klan apparently base -PRON- leaflet ’s message upon an article on the KKK website which call for the abolishing of Martin Luther King Jr. Day
but this idea that King be a communist be hardly a new one
at one time FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover call King the most notorious liar in the country and Alabama ’s Democratic Governor George Wallace say that President Kennedy want -PRON- to surrender this state to Martin Luther King and -PRON- group of pro Communists who have institute these demonstration
roadside billboard even purport to prove with photo that King attend a communist training camp
today these claim be see as a smear campaign and a relic of a time when unpopular figure of politic be label as communist
but that ’ not to say King do not associate -PRON- with people with communist leaning
in a new book Dangerous Friendship author Ben Kamin document Martin Luther King Jr. ’s friendship with a trust adviser name Stanley Levison who actually be a one time member of the Communist Party
due to this history even some of Levison ’s friend tell -PRON- -PRON- could bring King down with -PRON- dangerous friendship
unfortunately this friendship do lead to the FBI investigate Levison and King
accord to KPBS the accusation relate to communism break up the ability of the Kennedy brother to support the civil right movement before President Kennedy die
but what be King ’s actual belief
although modern conservative progressive and even socialist have try to claim King as -PRON- own if -PRON- read where do -PRON- go from here
-PRON- ’ obvious
at least that King be not a communist
now do not think that -PRON- have -PRON- in a bind today
-PRON- be not talk about Communism
what -PRON- be say to -PRON- this morning be that Communism forget that life be individual
capitalism forget that life be social and the Kingdom of Brotherhood be find neither in the thesis of Communism nor the antithesis of capitalism but in a high synthesis
-PRON- be find in a high synthesis that combine the truth of both
base upon that brief section -PRON- ’ also obvious that Martin Luther King ’s exact political belief be complicate but the Ku Ku Klax be dead wrong to pigeonhole the civil right leader as communist
unfortunately accord to the Daily Mail -PRON- ’ possible
the second part of the KKK accusation may have have some truth to -PRON-
civil right leader Reverand Ralph Abernathy may have be the man who cradle King as -PRON- lie die from an assassin ’s bullet in 1968 but Abernathy be also the same man who confirm rumor of King ’s history of adultery and sex
in -PRON- autobiography Abernathy claim that King understand and believe in the biblical prohibition against sex outside marriage
-PRON- be just that -PRON- have a particularly difficult time with that temptation
King may have have four child with Coretta Scott but Abernathy claim King spend -PRON- last night alive enjoy -PRON- with two lover
regardless Martin Luther King
Jr. Day commemorate the memorable action of this flawed saint who once admit there be a Mr Hyde and a Dr Jekyll in all of -PRON-
-PRON- do not need to go out this morning
say that Martin Luther King be a saint
the Ku Klux Klan may try to drag down the civil right movement by focus on these flaw but what be best remember be King ’s dream for the United States

the group of Radical Brownies be comprise of girl age eight to 11 and be organize about one month ago by Marilyn Hollinquest and -PRON- friend Anayvette Martinez
Martinez decide to form the troop after -PRON- daughter Coatlupe say -PRON- want to join a girl group accord to a CBS News affiliate report
Radical Brownies troop focus on social justice
Troop be not affiliate with Girl Scouts http://t.co/u7tvlpwug3 sound around @_SoundAround February 13 2015
the group ’s Facebook page describe the mission of the troop as an effort to empower young girl of color so that -PRON- step into -PRON- collective power brilliance and leadership in order to make the world a more radical place
during the CBS News interview Marilyn Hollinquest say how amazing would -PRON- be to have a girl troop that be really focus around social justice and where girl could even earn badge
the Radical Brownies earn -PRON- first badge by march in a Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade in Oakland
the badge feature a fist emblazon with the word black life matter
white policeman be kill black young folk such as woman man and child one of the Radical Brownies state during a recent troop meeting
another girl add Mike Brown
-PRON- be shoot because -PRON- do not do nothing
only the police officer shoot -PRON- because of -PRON- skin color
part of the Radical Brownies uniform be a brown beret
one of the member of the troop explain that -PRON- beret be a Black Panther Brown Beret twist
Marilyn Hollinquest add -PRON- think -PRON- ’ very appropriate
a lot of the work the Black Panthers do be community orient
-PRON- be big issue
but -PRON- also feel like these be conversation that -PRON- be not too young to be have
the co founder of the Radical Brownies describe -PRON- as queer woman of color and avid trans allies who help develop trans and gender non conforming inclusive space for the troop of girl
the Radical Brownies have reportedly receive a host of backlash in the few week since the troop be form

that night -PRON- encounter Jordan Baker around the back side of the shopping center
Baker wear a hoodie be confront by Castro about why -PRON- be there
accord to Castro there be no other witness -PRON- interrogate Baker because -PRON- match the description of someone who previously have burglarize the store
-PRON- say there be a physical altercation and a foot chase follow by Baker turn reach into -PRON- waistband and charge Castro
Castro shoot Baker who die
Baker be unarmed
Castro have no injury
when bring up before a grand jury the case be deem not to have sufficient evidence to go to trial by jury which mean that like other officer before -PRON- Castro would go free without ever stand trial before a jury of -PRON- peer
Jordan Baker leave behind a son Jordan Baker
Jr. -PRON- be a college student and work part time to support -PRON- family
Baker 's love one and the community around -PRON- continue the rally cry for justice like those who call for the same after the death of Trayvon Martin Mike Brown Eric Garner and score of other
the response have be largely peaceful amplify message like Hands up do not shoot and black life matter
but despite these nonviolent response to such unnecessary loss of life some in -PRON- experience all white people raise objection
rather than black life matter -PRON- argue -PRON- should say all live matter
so why be this inappropriate
there be a number of reason actually
first these cry be direct response to the loss of black life
-PRON- be a nonviolent corporate response to power that be wield violently
-PRON- be a response to a judicial system that historically incarcerate black man at a rate staggeringly high than -PRON- white counterpart for the same crime
-PRON- be a response of a community condition to fear the very one swear to protect -PRON-
such grief despair and helplessness demand a response from within -PRON-
WE MATTER be a call to be recognize value and care for
second there be no implication in the phrase black life matter that -PRON- matter any more than any other life
rather -PRON- be a response to a societal phenomenon that seem if without word to say those black life matter less
-PRON- be a call to nonviolent resistance in the spirit of King Gandhi and even Jesus
third the co opting of black life matter into all life matter touch a deep historical nerve of which those with racial privilege may not be aware
but as the old saying go ignorance be no excuse
grant the practice of slavery by mean of force be no long legal in -PRON- culture but -PRON- have not stop the dominant culture from take valuable contribution to american society and co opt -PRON- adapt -PRON- and quite often profit greatly from -PRON-
from science and literature to the art and entertainment the pattern be well establish
so -PRON- be understandable if African Americans bristle at the perhaps well intend desire of other to change -PRON- call for equality and justice into something broad and therefore absent of -PRON- be particular potency for the situation at hand
rather than resist or try to change such cry there be an opportunity for those of -PRON- in historically privileged and powerful position in the culture to listen learn and well understand the longing behind the word
the responsibility be on -PRON- to help make room for such voice to help amplify -PRON- and to use what power and privilege -PRON- have to exact the kind of change that ultimately would lead to a society in which chant as black life matter would no longer be necessary

hazy remix of Sophocles in world of gang gun 1 5 back to Gallery
gang warfare be destroy the city gun be epidemic and a corrupt ambitious mayor be act like a dictator
the classic wrestle of Sophocles Antigone between civil disobedience in the face of injustice and authority for the sake of stability do not register very strongly amid the urban turmoil in Nambi E. Kelley ’s modern remix xtigone
nor do the central family tragedy of the four child of Oedipus and -PRON- mother wife Jocasta in the african American Shakespeare Company world premiere direct by the estimable Rhodessa Jones that open Saturday
Kelley an emerge Chicago playwright be up to something else
-PRON- Xtigone be an attempt to harness the tragic power of Sophocles verse with -PRON- own considerable poetic skill to evoke the terrible plague of gun availability and the killing of young black man in -PRON- city and the potent image of Antigone as a feminist crusader for justice
-PRON- ’ an uneasy fit not just because large social tragedy tend to overwhelm individual personal one but due to some of Kelley and Jones choice
but -PRON- have moment of considerable power enhance by a viscerally move score by Tommy Emcee Soulati Shepherd
this be a hip hop world
Kelley ’s
Antigone be Tigs a vital Ryan Nicole Austin
-PRON- two brother have not kill each other offstage fighting over the throne but open the play as rival gang leader murder in a drive by in the midst of establish a truce
the city ’s ruler -PRON- antagonist and uncle be Mayor Marcellus play by Dwight Dean Mahabir as a smooth personable politician too pliant in the hand of -PRON- scheme wife Fay Jasmine Strange and speechwriter Tea Flake the slinky sharp Naima Shalhoub
singe strong hip hop commentary
Michael Wayne Turner be genially sincere and passionate as Tig ’s boyfriend and Marcellus son Beau
the social theme get lose in Kelley ’s
remix of tragedy with melodrama and tv police story focus on the simplistic question of who arrange the drive by -PRON-
’s pretty obvious
and who ’ flood the hood with gun
then too Tigs notion of civil disobedience be such a horrendous public health menace that -PRON- defy credibility while -PRON- dead brother E Mem AeJay Mitchell who inspire -PRON- hang around too long more as an icon than a fully realize character
the feminist theme get off to a more interesting start in a crisp dynamic showdown between Tigs and Tavia Percia as -PRON- sassy no time for fool sister Izzy
but apart from that scene the idea be less dramatize than baldly state once too often in a vivid ode to empower figure
Jones for the most part make good use of -PRON- large uneven cast use everyone even tig in choral song and movement scene and highlight the strong presence of Awele Makeba as a Spirit and comic skill of Howard Johnson as Marcellus fearful henchman
there be unintentionally funny gaffe however such as the trite use of zombie and project text message respond to yet another murder no
OMG
WTF
but if Kelley ’s structure be awkward -PRON- passionate poetic language carry the play a long way
in a reflection of how much civil disobedience be bubble up in the national consciousness xtigone be the first and most contemporary of three very different version of Antigone hit Bay Area stage this month and next
as root as -PRON- be in the now Kelley do not focus on chant of black life matter
in Xtigone that ’ a give
and a vital unavoidable takeaway

hundred of Houstonians gather Sunday for a vigil honor the three Muslim college student shoot and kill last week in Chapel Hill North Carolina slaying that have unleash speculation and sorrow across the country
line four corner of a busy intersection in the heart of the Galleria member of Houston 's Muslim community say -PRON- be not there in protest or to debate whether the act be a hate crime but instead to call attention to the shooting and pay tribute to the victim
Deah Shaddy Barakat 23 -PRON- wife Yusor Mohammad Abu Salha 21 and -PRON- sister Razan Mohammad Abu Salha 19
as normal Sunday shopping traffic whiz by participant light candle and quietly raise sign that bear message include be -PRON- next and Muslims for peace
all three of -PRON- symbolize for -PRON- community the epitome of a good Muslim say Dania Albaba president of United Muslim Relief Houston

in the medium -PRON- so often see a bad muslim
so for -PRON- -PRON- be like -PRON- have to honor these people who at first really do not get that much media attention
all three victim accord to medium report be active in a Chapel Hill chapter of United Muslim Relief a humanitarian group that work in develop country
the Houston chapter along with the University of Houston Muslim Students Association organize Sunday 's vigil
amid the tribute there be deep concern about the motive of the allege shooter Craig Stephen Hicks
Chapel Hill police say a preliminary investigation suggest the shooting stem from a long simmer parking dispute but the FBI have open -PRON- own inquiry as allegation that Hicks commit a hate crime continue to escalate
locally a fire that may have be intentionally set at a southeast Houston Islamic center on Friday have only add to the grow unease for many Muslims who by some estimate account for 1.2 percent of the city 's population
that statistic would make Houston home to the state 's large muslim population
to hear about the fire at the mosque that be very hard say Samah Haider 31
-PRON- be a very personal moment to see something like that happen here
-PRON- be just shocked
-PRON- be a sentiment that resonate with many at the vigil who describe -PRON- reaction to the event as unnerve shock
for some of the student in attendance the shooting hit close to home
-PRON- first reaction be that -PRON- could have happen to any of -PRON- say Samreen Gazi a student at the University of Houston Downtown
-PRON- be young muslim student at a university too
muslim live matter Gazi add reference a riff on the black life matter slogan use by protester in the wake of the shooting of an unarmed black man in Ferguson Mo.
as late afternoon turn to evening those gather light small white candle while other pray
a few driver honk -PRON- horn in solidarity
-PRON- be not here to make a political statement Albaba say
-PRON- be here to honor the victim
-PRON- hope people recognize that
about a month and a half ago some in law enforcement and those look to hinder progress demonize activist of all stripe from civil right organization like National Action Network NAACP and National Urban League to young group do good work and raise legitimate issue of concern include the black life Matter campaign
-PRON- be wrongly accuse of be anti police and some even have the audacity to try and say that -PRON- somehow create a climate for cop to be shoot
even President Obama and New York City Mayor de Blasio be blame because -PRON- like -PRON- understand the very real urgency of speak out in favor of improve relation between the police and the community -PRON- serve
last week FBI Director James Comey say virtually the same thing in an unprecedented speech
while -PRON- do not agree with everything -PRON- say now that a White republican lead law enforcement official have call for reform maybe just maybe the message may get through
and today in an exclusive MSNBC interview just release Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg say the follow about race People who think -PRON- could wave a magic wand and the legacy of the past will be over be blind
now that the FBI Director and a sit Supreme Court judge have speak maybe people will stop name calling and let -PRON- deal with the gravity of the issue
a few day ago officer Peter Liang be indict in the November shoot death of unarmed Akai Gurley in a dark stairwell of a housing complex in Brooklyn
while -PRON- applaud this indictment -PRON- do not negate the large issue -PRON- can not play russian roulette to get the right prosecutor
a prosecutor can get an indictment for a police officer that shoot in the dark but another prosecutor fail to get one for an officer that choke a person in broad daylight on videotape while that civilian yell -PRON- can not breathe 11 time
the politic of prosecution must be take out so that -PRON- have objectivity and fairness
-PRON- message like Director Comey 's have always be that not all police be bad in fact most be good
but if -PRON- do not hold the bad one accountable then -PRON- be tell -PRON- that -PRON- be somehow above the law and that justice exist only for some
first all of -PRON- in law enforcement must be honest enough to acknowledge that much of -PRON- history be not pretty
at many point in american history law enforcement enforce the status quo a status quo that be often brutally unfair to disfavor group say Comey during -PRON- speech
while -PRON- make this and other salient point Comey make some statement about young man of color crime and cynicism of police officer that -PRON- do not agree with nor endorse
but -PRON- overall message of reform police method in this country improve relation between community and law enforcement and speak to each other honestly about all of these hard truth must be hear
-PRON- do not matter who the messenger be as long as these significant word be receive especially by those who appear to be tone deaf
change never happen overnight
as Justice Ginsburg say a magic wand will not solve -PRON-
as one who have study the great teaching of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. -PRON- can honestly say that -PRON- never occur with one protest or one boycott
rather -PRON- be a movement a concerted push for reform from the ground up
-PRON- take everyone from activist in the street to lawmaker and law enforcement director to highlight -PRON- challenge and actively fight for progress
those on the wrong side of history will always try to attack and demonize people champion what be right
-PRON- often forget that even Dr. King be not always revere and love by society in fact -PRON- be paint as a troublemaker and hate by many
while none of -PRON- can ever compare -PRON- to the tremendous work -PRON- do and the example -PRON- set forth -PRON- can try to emulate -PRON- dedication to the cause of justice even in the face of the harsh form of oppression
in the month since the tragic death of Eric Garner Michael Brown Akai Gurley and Tamir Rice there have be officer involve killing of many other across this country that simply do not make the headline
this be why -PRON- can not rest
while -PRON- may not cosign everything Director Comey say -PRON- must acknowledge that this be a moment of advancement and -PRON- must seize upon this moment
People be still suffer
People not those of -PRON- that play various role in the public space but everyday people must be protect
no one should bury a child mother father or grandparent because of someone else 's bias
and no one should be force to deal with prosecutor who may have a conflict of interest when go after bad police officer
peaceful chant marching and organizing have bring -PRON- to this moment people be pay attention
now -PRON- be -PRON- job to make this renew attention lead to sustainable result
at the end of the day -PRON- do not matter who the messenger be as long as those that be the hard to reach can hear -PRON-
